You see a huge number of products visiting a supermarket? Wide range of products at a different price and quality from various producers? You aren't sure whether the food you are buying has been transported properly as well as its ingredients? Take your phone and discover it at no time.

Problems solved
-----------
* Consumers are able to get to know what they are going to buy and eat
* Producers prove their production to be at a quality
* Transportation companies prove an excellent level of their services

How it works
-----------
* Farmers and other ingredients suppliers ship their goods to a food factories. Items delivery is being monitored with an IoT device measuring temperature, humidity, light and GPS location
* All interactions between farmers, food factories and shops are being verified with a smart contract (letter of credit)
* When buyer comes to a supermarket, he is able to pick up any item on the shelf to scan a QR code that instantly redirects to an Web Page with a candy looking infographic data showing end to end history from farmers to a shop.
* All relevant documentation designed to be saved to IPFS.
* Sensors data is saved to a relational DB and its hashed data is saved on the blockchain to prove its genuine.
